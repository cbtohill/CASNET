# Measuring the structure of high-redshift galaxies with deep learning

Here we show a demonstration of the networks created and used in the paper [Quantifying non-parametric structure of high-redshift galaxies with deep learning, Tohill et al. 2020 ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09081).  

The goal of this work is to train a deep learning algorithm, in this case we chose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to predict the CAS paprameters of a galaxy from a single input image. 
We include a notebook to show how to load and run the networks (CASNET.ipynb) as well as a python script to allow you to run the training yourself on your own data (cnn_cas.py).
