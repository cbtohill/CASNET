# Measuring the structure of high-redshift galaxies with deep learning

Here we show a demonstration of the networks created and used in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09081. 

The goal of this is to train a deep learning algorithm, in this case we chose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to predict the CAS paprameters of a galaxy from
a single input image. 
We include a notebook to show how to load and run the networks (include file name) as well as a notebook to allow you to run the training yourself.
